<h2>Day 2 : Lambda Expressions<h2>

<h2>Exercise #1:</h2>

Open the Numbers.java file.  This file contains a Numbers class that has the following method signatures:

* isOdd(i)
* isEven(i)
* isPrime(i)
* added()
* subtracted()
* multiplied()
* divided()
* findMax()
* findMin()
* compare(i,j)
* append(n)

1. Complete all of the above instance methods, and test your methods by running all of them in the main() method of the lambda.Numbers class.  Display the output to the console. 

2. Convert all of the above instance methods into lambda expressions in the main() method of the Numbers class.  Give the lambda expressions names that are slightly different than the instance methods.  Verify your code by printing the output of the lambda expressions to the console.

<h2>Exercise #2:</h2>

Open the Animals.java file. This file contains an Animals class that has the following method signatures:
* capsFirst(List l, boolean b)
* addAnimal(String animal)
* lowerFirst(List l, boolean b)
* flipAnimals(boolean b)
* sortAnimals(boolean b)

1. Complete all of the above methods, and test your methods by running all of them in the main() method of Names.  Display the output to the console.

2. Refactor the methods to accept lambda expressions as arguments.  Verify your code by printing the output of the methods to the console.

<h2>Bonus: </h2>

* Add your own method that accepts a lambda expression as an argument to generate a list of random animals, that gets added to the animals list.
* Allow the sortNames() method to let users specify a custom sorting algorithm, passed in as a lambda expression.  If no custom sorting algorithm specified, sortNames() should provide a default alphabetical sorting algorithm.
* Refactor the Numbers and Names java files into JavaScript.

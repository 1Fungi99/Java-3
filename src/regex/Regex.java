You can borrows books from the library, or you can buy them from the bookstore. I'm not sure if I prefer paperback books or hardcover books.  I'm such a nerd that I even like textbooks.  With the advent of technology, you can even buy digital books, such as kindle-books, nook-books, or other e-books. My personal favorite book format are pdf-books, because I don't have to carry so many books around wherever I go.  All the books are on my ipad or laptop.  When I lived abroad, they would give books to students absolutely free.  Free books for a student of knowledge is like a kid in a candy store.  So wipe the dust off of your books, and remember the slogan from 'reading rainbow' : 'Take a look! It's in a book! Reading Rainbow!";
